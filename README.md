# Global Power Hackathon

**[Countries list (2023)](https://github.com/thinkgradient/global-power-hackathon/blob/main/countries_2023.xlsx) These are the countries you will be analysing in these tasks.**

## Tasks
Groups will complete a keystone task as well as one innovation task as part of this hackathon.

# Keystone task
***What you are trying to create:***
A client facing dashboard which incorporates features which showcases functionality of the user,(e.g., data sets they want to use to create visualisations) as well as pre made visualisations and crossindex/cross regional analysis that you as the hacker can create.

***Your Task:***

Using the mock data which we will provide you will create:

* A client facing dashboard which will resemble a functional dashboard which allows a typical client of Pareto Economics to see, select and interact with the data we will provide to you.These should include mock tabs, a professional appearance to the dashboard and functionality you think a client in the government, corporate and investment sector would like to see.
* You will also create a number of visualisations and analysis on the mock data with corresponding conclusions you think are interesting and useful to draw for the above client archetype. These can include cross regional/cross index trends, intra-regional trends and forecasting assumptions on the data. These will be presented in a PDF format with light to medium level of analysis on each visualisation which allows the client to better understand what the visualisations mean and why it is useful to them.

Dataset: [Mock Data](https://www.google.com/url?sa=D&q=Mock%2520Data%2520Hackathon.xlsx&ust=1668455460000000&usg=AOvVaw1DaMogT2Jpwg7T0pHuYZUE&hl=en&source=gmail)

***Top Tip:*** When creating the dashboard, it is important to see examples of what exists already online so do your research, also feel free to take advantage of interviewing the judges as to what they think a dashboard should include and the functionality.

As it relates to the visualisations think about what you can create which gives better insights andunderstanding of how Globalisation, Geopolitics, Transformative Technology and societal Change will impact the world from the mock data. Use the data to showcase an understanding on how this data can provide real world insights and understanding on current and potential future issues as it relates to GGTS for the client archetypes.

# Innovation Tasks
Below is a selection of 4 innovation tasks you will be also required to work on. Select one to work onusing the datasets available as well as associated datasets which are listed at the end of this document. Also, make sure to use the insights and direction of the judges/mentors to help your team create something truly innovative and useful. No question is a silly question!

### **Friend & Adversaries**

***What you are trying to create:*** 

A high-level assessment of the economic, political and social relationships between a target country and their neighbours.

***Your task:***

Your task is to create a useable interactive ranking framework which is able to measure and calculate a countries relationship with its neighbours. This should incorporate an interactive map and an associated rating system which allows an analyst to incorporate a rating which can assess the relationships between a target country and its radius of neighbours. (Pleaserequest an example of a rating system which we can provide as a basis for the creation of your own one).

* The relationship should extend a maximum of 3 countries radius including its direct border neighbours (land and sea) and 2 more steps removed.
* It should have the option to reflect a scale from a positive to a negative relationshipbetween the target country and its associated neighbours.
* The target country should at the end of the ranking be assigned a score/valuereflecting its relationships with its neighbours.

***Top Tip:***

Some may fall into the trap of creating a binary measure of relationship status (e.g., Ally oradversary) this is a very reductionist measure and not very helpful. When creating this metric make sure to reflect foreign policy on a continuum of sorts.

***Dataset:*** [List of countries and territories by land and maritime borders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_territories_by_land_and_maritime_borders) 

***Bonus Points:***

As well as completing the task you will receive bonus points if you go the extra mile and create an adjacent innovation which complements the aims of the task. This bonus task will give you the opportunity to get creative with the aim of extracting more value for the analyst.

### **Oil/Gas pipeline map**

***What you are trying to create:*** 

A measure which reflects the importance of oil & gas suppliers, buyers and transit countries (especially as it relates to pipelines).

***Your task:***

Your task is to create a visualisation/metric which identifies only-cross border oil and gas pipelines with insights as to whether the pipeline is dual directional or not and to identify where the pipeline begins, ends and the countries it goes through and to assign a value on a source nation, transit nation and customer nation.

 * Remember we are not measuring the pipelines themselves but rather how many pipeline start, end and transit through a country.
 * You will create and assign a value for eac categorisation (start, end, transit) based on anagreed upon assumption on their importance.
* You will only include pipelines which are currently operational and not pipelines which aredecommissioned, offline or in the process of being built.
* The result will be a total value/figure assigned to a country which takes into consideration the total number of cross border gas/oil pipelines.

***Top Tip:***

This task requires a keen eye on many important things like the route of a pipeline (sometimes cross border pipelines which you may think naturally transit a certain country do not and sometimes they do), the directionally of the pipeline is also important so make sure to get this right.

***Bonus Points:***

As well as completing the task you will receive bonus points if you go the extra mile and create an adjacent innovation which complements the aims of the task. This bonus task will give you theopportunity to get creative with the aim of extracting more value for the analyst



### **Commodities mix**

***What you are trying to create:*** 

A catalogue of a number of hard & soft commodities which all the countries produce.

***Your task:***

Your task is to create a commodities map which tracks the production of a number of hard and soft commodities in a country denominated in the commodities type. E.G., bpd for oil.

The commodities include:
Oil, Gas, Gold, Iron, Copper, Aluminium, Zinc, Manganese, Lead, Nickel, Silver, Graphite,Titanium, Platinum, Tin, Palladium, Molybdenum, Rare Earths, Uranium, Lithium, Sugar,Corn (Maize), Soybeans, Coffee, Cocoa, Cotton, Wheat

* You will display the yearly total quantity of these commodities for the latest year e.g., 2022 or if data is not available then 2021 quantities.
* This can be displayed in an excel spreadsheet or other software visualisation platform
* For countries which do not produce a certain commodity this cell can be left blank.

***Dataset:***

***Bonus Points:***

As well as completing the task you will receive bonus points if you go the extra mile and create an adjacent innovation which complements the aims of the task. This bonus task will give you the opportunity to get creative with the aim of extracting more value for the analyst.


### **5G Reediness analysis**

***What you are trying to create:*** 

An assessment of the 5G reediness of a country including current 5g infrastructure.

***Your Task:***

Your task is to create a mini-index which analysis the wholistic efforts of a country in regardsto its current 5G infrastructure.

* Current measures already exist but are limited to analysis a limited number of countries.
* You will have the opportunity to see how other organisations measure the 5G reediness of a country and improve upon this measure and extend it to all 190 countries.
* You will be assessed on the relevance of your variables, the weighting of the variables and the overall accuracy of creating a mini-index which reflects the aims of this task
